# SICP: Structures and Interpretations of Computer Programs

This is my home of my notes and workthrough of SICP following the [MIT 6.037 course](http://web.mit.edu/alexmv/6.037/).

I've organized each folder into a notes and an exercises directory. I'd suggest
going through the book on your own and refering to the notes for clarification
or further resources if someone has added them.

Feel free to make pull requests on better implementations and corrections to notes
that you think might be of use.
